# WireGetRelatedListRefresh
Demo of refreshing a related list loaded via the wire adapter [getRelatedListRecords](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/lwc/guide/reference-wire-adapters-get-related-list-records.html)/[getRelatedListRecordsBatch](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/lwc/guide/reference-wire-adapters-get-related-list-records-batch.html)

Note - this does NOT refresh, at this time I have not found how to get the list to refresh

RefreshApex is deprecated for refreshing of wire objects not from Apex

notifyRecordUpdateAvailable does not seem to trigger a refresh of the related list
